# BackendPractical

NodeJS/Express Application used as a proxy for the Twitter API.  

## Features

This application provides one function: it acts as a proxy server between a web-based client and the Twitter API, and provides one endpoint to search recent tweets on Twitter. It accepts Search Term and Maximum Results inputs as query parameters to do some basic filtering of data from Twitter.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` from the project root for a dev server. The server will be hosted at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
